## Intro

Once there was a tiny Red Planet.
It is a home of thriving civilization
that already has WiFi.

But the planet got into an ecological disaster,
that could destroy any life.

You have all the know-how needed to save
such an advanced civilization.
All you have to do is sent it.

However, the planet is located so far away,
that you need to rely on the cosmic relay network
to pass the message.

Pass the needed sequence of commands to
turn the dishes and relay the message.
