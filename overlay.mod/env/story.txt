One day in a strange galaxy
there was a dying Red planet...

That planet is the home to a thriving civilization
that already has WiFi

You need to relay a message how to save their planet
Your highly advanced technical culture
has all needed know-how.

But the Red planet is so far away,
you need to rely on the network
of advanced orbital transmitters
to relay the message

Use arrow keys/WASD to turn transmitters
and relay message to the Red planet
